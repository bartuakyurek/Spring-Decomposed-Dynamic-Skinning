# Spring Decomposed Dynamic Skinning
 This repository demonstrates a dynamic deformation achieved by adding spring helper bones to an 
existing geometric skinning pipeline. Note that it's a work in progress. Currently you can run either 
the files under ./tests/ or ./demo/ directories, e.g. ``python ./tests/spring_bone_test.py``.
